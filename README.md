# First Map Template Repository

This is a fork of
<https://github.com/cu-esiil-edu/first-map-template/>.
It includes Python code to develop a `first map` of
a campus of my choice
(UW-Madison).
It also includes 
[first-map.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell-Tribal/first-map-template/blob/main/first-map.Rmd),
R markdown code to do the same thing in R,
producing static and dynamic
([tmap](https://github.com/r-tmap/tmap))
maps.

There is also a rudimentary Shiny app `osmApp()` in
[first-map.R](https://github.com/byandell-Tribal/first-map-template/blob/main/first-map.R).
This currently only allows the option of UW-Madison
and produces a static map.

A beginning (and partially broken) idea on
[osm_Col.Rmd](https://github.com/byandell-Tribal/first-map-template/blob/main/osm_Col.Rmd)
investigates how to work directly with OSM data.
